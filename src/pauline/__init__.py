"""
Pauline Neural Study
====================

A novel computational approach to analyzing the Pauline corpus using only
Paul's own words. Employs bootstrap resampling, combinatorial recombination,
cross-epistle transfer embeddings, and other statistical methods to expand
and analyze Paul's writings without external corpus contamination.

Methodology based on the principle that Paul's corpus is a closed statistical
universe: every expansion, sampling, and generation technique operates
exclusively on Paul's authentic vocabulary, syntax, and semantic patterns.
